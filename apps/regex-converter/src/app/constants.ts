export const sampleInput = `This text will be processed & converted to the one on the right side.
The rules below will be used to successively replace regular expressions.
For example, the default rule 01 replace dots with cats !
The second rule delete the word "right" by replacing him with nothing.
The last sample rule prefix each lines with dashes :) but you'll have to enable it.

Pretty neat right ?

Tutorial is over, paste your own text, customize the rules, you can have more rules by adding them with the (+) button below :)`
