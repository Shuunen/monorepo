# User Scripts

> Personal heavily opinionated script I make to enhance my daily web experience.

## Usage

![demo](docs/demo.gif)

1. Make sure you have [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) installed
2. Open the script you want to use (use raw view)
3. Review the code, no one should trust a random script from the internet
4. Install the script in your browser

## Prompt to follow guidelines

Acknowledge the guidelines for user scripts inside `.github/copilot-instructions.md` then fix all issues listed by `nx lint user-scripts` command.

At the end run `nx typecheck user-scripts` and `nx test user-scripts` to make sure you have not break anything.

Don't provide me any explanations/comments/summary, just iterate, fix all the issues and run the commands at the end.
