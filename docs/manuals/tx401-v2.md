## Fix the disconnect issue on heavy network transfers

### Linux

On Ubuntu 25 the only fix was to go into Settings > Network > Aquantia Ethernet > Options :

- Into the identity tab set the MTU to 10240 (I found this value in Netgear WebUI)
- Into the IPV6 tab I simply disabled it

### Windows

Add the "Reliable Multicast Protocol" (steps 1 to 8) :

![config](./images/tx401-v2-config.jpg)

Then at step 9 set these specific options :

- Energy Efficient Ethernet: Off
- Flow Control: Off
- Interrupt Moderation: Disabled
- Interrupt Moderation Rate: Disabled
- Receive Side Scaling: Disabled

After all these changes, I managed to have a stable connection with heavy network transfers. But the [nPerf](https://www.nperf.com/fr/) was still able to disconnect the network adapter.
