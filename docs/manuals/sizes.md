Sizes vary a lot from one brand to another but here are the sizes I currently wear:

- EU sizes: L, 42 to 46
- US sizes: W32 to W34, L32 to L34

The min/max are included, so my average size is 44 EU and W33 L33 US.

Waist & hips measurement: 90cm, 90/2 = size 45 EU normally but size 44 EU is better

Jean size: width 44cm +- 1 or 2 cm (my waist circumference), length 107cm +-3cm (of which 76cm legs)

Last time at Uniqlo I got several slim fit Chinos 34x32 inch (so 86.5 x 81.5 cm), 40€ each

## Belts

Size L

| ------------------- | :-------: | :-------------: | :---------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
| Length (total)      |  108 cm   |     110 cm      | 112-117 cm  |     122 cm      |    124 cm     |
| Length (leather)    |  103 cm   |     105 cm      | 107-112 cm  |     116 cm      |    118 cm     |

When I bought the Levi's one (24€ on Amz), the size mentioned was 110, which happened to be the total length of the belt (leather + buckle). The leather part alone was 105 cm.

When I bought the Tommy Hilfiger one (25€ on Amz), the size mentioned was 110, which corresponds to nothing, the total length was 130 cm and the leather part alone was 125 cm.

## Body fat

Waist measurement on 24/01/22 : 95 cm
Neck measurement on 24/01/22 : 37 cm
Height : 184 cm
86.010*log(95-37)-70.041*log(184)+30.30 = 23.34%

## Shoes

Heel to toe length: 28/29 cm

## Socks

39/42 EU is perfect in the end, 43+ is too big.

## Watches

17cm wrist circumference
